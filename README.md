Date: February 12, 2024

## Description:

This repository houses a Jupyter notebook that serves as a complete guide to using Python for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The notebook's content covers a wide range of topics, from initial steps like importing libraries and reading data to advanced techniques like sentiment analysis and text generation.

## Topics covered:

* Import of essential libraries into PLN.
* Collection and processing of data from the web, including techniques for cleaning and pre-processing.
* POS (Part-of-Speech) marking, a fundamental technique for syntactic analysis.
* Lemmatization and Stemization, word normalization processes that simplify textual analysis.
* Loading and manipulating text in different formats.
* Using the spaCy library to perform advanced text searches and analysis.
* Named entity extraction, a crucial technique for identifying and categorizing specific information in text.
* Creation of word clouds and treatment of stop words for visualization and analysis of textual data.

## Requirements:

* Python 3.6 or later version.
* Jupyter Notebook.

## Required libraries:

* bs4: Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
* urllib.request: Module to handle HTTP requests in Python.
* nltk: Widely used library for natural language processing.
* spacy: A powerful NLP library for advanced text processing.

## How to use:

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Open the natural-language-processing.ipynb notebook in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially, following the instructions and adapting the code as needed for your specific context and data.

## Additional features:

* Full spaCy library documentation: https://spacy.io/
* Comprehensive NLP tutorials with the NLTK library: https://www.nltk.org/book/
* NLP course with Python offered by DeepLearning.AI: https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/

## Comments:

* This notebook is designed as an introductory tutorial, although it covers a variety of advanced concepts and techniques in NLP.
* To deepen your knowledge, it is recommended that you explore the additional resources mentioned above, which provide more detailed information and practical examples.
* The structure and content of the notebook can be adapted to meet the specific needs of different NLP projects and applications.

## Example of use:

The notebook can be used to analyze any text of interest. For example, you can use it to:

* Identify and categorize parts of speech (POS) in a text.
* Extract relevant information such as names of people, organizations and locations.
* Visualize the most frequent words in a text by creating a word cloud.
* Perform a sentiment analysis to determine the emotional polarity of the text.

## Benefits:

* This notebook provides a practical and comprehensive introduction to using Python in NLP projects.
* It makes it possible to carry out a variety of tasks and analyzes in NLP projects, from basic tasks to more advanced techniques.
* It is a valuable learning tool for students and professionals interested in exploring and applying NLP techniques in different contexts and domains.

## Contributions:

This is an open source project and community contribution is encouraged through suggestions for improvements and bug fixes. Interested parties can send pull requests to collaborate on the continuous improvement of the notebook and make it even more useful and comprehensive.
